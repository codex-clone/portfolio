  "problem": "Ship a privacy-first content generation tool with provider switching, SSR-safe UI, and measurable output quality.",
  "approach": "- Split React SSR shell from streaming FastAPI completion endpoints.\n- Implemented provider adapters with rate limiting and redaction policies.\n- Added eval harness scoring tone, length, and toxicity before release.",

  "results": [
    "SSR routes stayed <120ms TTFB under load testing.",
    "Provider swap cut blocked prompts by 42% week-over-week.",

    "Fallback provider lacks certain tone presets; flagged for manual edits.",
