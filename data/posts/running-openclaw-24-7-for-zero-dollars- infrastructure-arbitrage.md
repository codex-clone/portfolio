# Running OpenClaw 24/7 for Literally $0: The Infrastructure Arbitrage Nobody's Talking About

While the AI world is losing its mind over OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot, then Moltbot), there's a more fascinating story happening beneath the surface. Most people are spending $15-25 per day running their AI assistants. Meanwhile, developers like Aditya Singh have figured out how to run the exact same setup for literally zero dollars.

This isn't clickbait. This isn't about "free trials" that expire in 30 days. This is about understanding cloud infrastructure economics well enough to exploit legitimate arbitrage opportunities that most developers completely miss.

What is OpenClaw (Clawdbot)?

Before we dive into the infrastructure magic, let's understand what we're dealing with. OpenClaw is an open-source personal AI assistant that's gone viral with 68,000+ GitHub stars in just a matter of days. Created by PSPDFKit founder Peter Steinberger, it's had more name changes than Diddy (Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw).

What makes it special?
- Full system access: Unlike ChatGPT, OpenClaw can read/write files, run commands, execute scripts, and control your browser
- True autonomy: It can manage your calendar, clear your inbox, send emails, check you in for flights
- Multi-platform integration: Works through WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, iMessage
- Self-hosted: You control the data, the compute, and the costs

The problem? Most people are paying $15-25 daily to run it. That's $450-750 per month. For a single bot.

That's insane.

The Traditional Setup (And Why It's Expensive)

Here's what most guides tell you to do:

1. Spin up a cloud VM: AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, or GCP e2-medium instance
2. Pay standard rates: Around $25-30/month for always-on compute
3. Use Claude API: $15-25/day in API costs depending on usage
4. Total cost: $500-800/month

For something that's supposed to be "open-source and free," that's a brutal reality check.

The $0 Architecture: How It Actually Works

Here's where Aditya Singh's setup becomes fascinating. It's not about cutting corners—it's about understanding three different arbitrage opportunities that stack on top of each other.

🏗️ Layer 1: The Infrastructure Hack

The Problem with Standard VMs:
Running an e2-medium instance (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) on Google Cloud Platform costs approximately $24.46/month at standard rates. That's the baseline most people accept.

The Spot VM Optimization:
Google Cloud offers "Spot VMs" (formerly called Preemptible VMs)—spare compute capacity that Google sells at a massive discount. The catch? Google can reclaim these instances at any moment with just 30 seconds notice.

For the e2-medium instance:
- Standard pricing: ~$25/month
- Spot pricing: ~$11/month in us-central1
- Savings: 56% cost reduction

But here's where it gets clever...

The Managed Instance Group (MIG) Solution:

Most people avoid Spot VMs because of the interruption problem. Your bot stops working when Google reclaims the instance. Not ideal for a "24/7 autonomous assistant."

The solution? Managed Instance Groups with Stateful Persistent Disks.

Here's how it works:yaml
Infrastructure Stack:
├── Managed Instance Group (Auto-healing)
│   └── Spot VM (e2-medium, us-central1-f)
│       ├── When reclaimed → Auto-restart new instance
│       └── Boot time: ~60-90 seconds
└── Stateful Persistent Disk (30GB)
    ├── Bot memory/state
    ├── Conversation logs
    ├── Database
    └── Survives instance migrations
What this achieves:
- Uptime: When Google reclaims your Spot VM, the Managed Instance Group automatically spawns a new one
- Persistence: The 30GB Stateful Persistent Disk contains all bot memory, logs, and database—it survives the migration
- Effective cost: ~$11/month for compute + minimal disk storage costs

It's a permanent mind in a rotating body.

💰 Layer 2: The Financial Arbitrage

Now here's where it gets wild. Running that Spot VM still costs $11/month. But what if you could subsidize that to zero?

The Google + Jio Partnership:

In October 2025, Google and Reliance Jio announced a partnership that's probably one of the most undervalued deals in tech:

- What: 18 months of Google AI Pro (worth ₹35,100 / ~$420 USD)
- Who: Jio users aged 18-25 on unlimited 5G plans (₹349+/month)
- What's included:
  - Google One Premium (2TB storage)
  - Google AI Pro access
  - $10/month Google Cloud credits

The math:
- Spot VM cost: $11/month
- Google Cloud credit from Jio bundle: $10/month
- Net cost: $1/month

With some additional optimization (choosing the absolute cheapest GCP region, fine-tuning instance scheduling), you can get to $0.

⚡ Layer 3: The Intelligence Optimization

Okay, so you've got free infrastructure. But what about the AI model costs? Claude Sonnet costs real money, and if you're using your bot heavily, that's where the $15-25/day expense comes from.

The GitHub Copilot + Grok Code Fast Hack:

Here's what most people don't realize: If you have a GitHub Copilot subscription ($10/month for Pro), you get access to grok-code-fast-1 for free with unlimited usage.

Grok Code Fast 1:
- Developed by xAI (Elon's AI company)
- Optimized for coding tasks
- Performance: Comparable to Claude Sonnet 3.5 for many tasks
- Cost: Free with GitHub Copilot (normally would be paid)
- Rate limits: Unlimited requests

When to use it:
- System tasks where speed > deep reasoning
- Code generation and debugging
- File manipulation and automation
- Calendar management, email parsing

The setup:bash
In your OpenClaw config
export AI_MODEL_PROVIDER="github_copilot"
export AI_MODEL="grok-code-fast-1"
Alternative free options if you don't have Copilot:
1. OpenCode: Free models (formerly offered Grok Code Fast for free)
2. NVIDIA NIM: Practically unlimited free tier (requires manual setup)
3. Gemini Flash 2.0: Google's free tier (generous limits)

🧠 Layer 4: Long-Term Memory

The final piece of the puzzle: making sure your bot never forgets anything, even after server restarts.

Gemini Embeddings (gemini-embedding-001):
- Free tier: Up to 1,000,000 tokens per minute
- Storage: That 30GB Persistent Disk (remember, it's stateful)
- Use case: High-speed vector searches across conversation history

How it works:
1. Every conversation gets embedded using gemini-embedding-001
2. Embeddings stored on the Persistent Disk
3. When bot restarts (after Spot VM migration), memory intact
4. Vector search enables semantic conversation recall

The result: Your bot remembers context from weeks ago, understands conversation threads, and maintains personality consistency—all without paid vector database services.

The Complete Stack: Bill of Materials

Let's break down the actual cost structure:

Infrastructure (Google Cloud)
Compute (e2-medium Spot VM, us-central1):
- Standard cost: $24.46/month
- Spot discount: $11/month
- Jio subsidy: -$10/month
- Net: $1/month → $0 with optimization

Persistent Disk (30GB Standard):
- Cost: ~$1.20/month
- Can be absorbed by free tier credits

Network Egress:
- First 1GB free, then minimal for bot operations
- Typical cost: > ~/.bashrc
Part 5: Claiming Jio Google Cloud Credits (India Only)

If you're in India and aged 18-25:

1. Activate Jio Google Gemini Offer:
   - Must have active Jio 5G unlimited plan (₹349+)
   - Visit Jio website or app
   - Navigate to "Google Gemini Offer"
   - Claim your 18-month Google AI Pro subscription

2. Redeem Google Cloud Credits:
   - Log into Google Cloud Console
   - Navigate to Billing → Credits
   - Your $10/month credit should appear automatically
   - Applied to GCP usage including Compute Engine

3. Verify Credits:bash
gcloud billing accounts list
gcloud billing accounts describe ACCOUNT_ID
Part 6: Setting Up Auto-restart After Spot Reclaim

The Managed Instance Group handles this automatically, but you need to ensure OpenClaw daemon starts on boot:bash
Create systemd service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/openclaw.service
ini
[Unit]
Description=OpenClaw AI Assistant
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ubuntu
WorkingDirectory=/mnt/stateful-disk/openclaw
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/.nvm/versions/node/v20.0.0/bin/clawdbot start
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
bash
Enable and start service
sudo systemctl enable openclaw
sudo systemctl start openclaw
sudo systemctl status openclaw
Part 7: Connecting Communication Channels

Telegram Bot Setup:

1. Message @BotFather on Telegram
2. Create new bot: /newbot
3. Get your bot token
4. Add to OpenClaw config:bash
clawdbot channel add telegram --token="your-bot-token"
WhatsApp Setup (requires WhatsApp Business API):bash
clawdbot channel add whatsapp --phone="+1234567890"
Alternative: The Hetzner Setup (More Reliable)

If you want guaranteed uptime without Spot VM interruptions:

1. Create Hetzner Cloud account

2. Deploy CX23 instance:
- 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 40GB SSD
- Cost: €3.79/month (~$4)
- Location: Choose nearest datacenter

3. SSH and install:bash
ssh root@your-server-ip

Install Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs

Install OpenClaw
npm install -g clawbot@latest

Run setup
clawdbot onboard --install-daemon
4. Same configuration as GCP (GitHub Copilot, Gemini embeddings, etc.)

  --schedule="0 0 * * *" \
  --uri="https://compute.googleapis.com/.../stop"
Troubleshooting Common Issues

Issue 1: Spot VM Reclaimed Too Frequently

Symptoms: Bot goes offline multiple times per day

Solutions:
- Try different zone (some have better Spot availability)
- Use Hetzner instead (guaranteed uptime)
- Upgrade to standard VM during critical periods

Issue 2: Persistent Disk Not Mounting

Symptoms: Bot loses memory after restart

Check:bash
lsblk  # Check if disk is attached
sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/stateful-disk
sudo nano /etc/fstab  # Add persistent mount
Issue 3: GitHub Copilot Rate Limits

Symptoms: Bot slows down or stops responding

Solutions:
- Check Copilot usage: https://github.com/settings/copilot
- Configure fallback model (Gemini Flash)
- Implement request throttling in OpenClaw config

Issue 4: Jio Credits Not Applying

Symptoms: Still getting charged despite having Jio subscription

Check:
- Verify Google account linked to Jio number
- Check credit status in GCP Billing console
- Contact Jio support (credits can take 24-48 hours)

Security Considerations

1. API Key Managementbash
Use Google Secret Manager (free tier available)
gcloud secrets create openclaw-keys \
  --data-file=./keys.json

Mount secrets in instance
gcloud compute instances add-metadata openclaw-instance \
  --metadata=google-secret=projects/PROJECT_ID/secrets/openclaw-keys
2. Network Securitybash
Restrict SSH access
gcloud compute firewall-rules update default-allow-ssh \
  --source-ranges=YOUR_IP/32

Use Identity-Aware Proxy
gcloud compute start-iap-tunnel openclaw-instance 22 \
  --local-host-port=localhost:2222
3. Data Encryptionbash
Encrypt persistent disk
gcloud compute disks create openclaw-data-encrypted \
  --size=30GB \
  --type=pd-standard \
  --encryption-key=my-encryption-key
The Ethics and Philosophy

Before you implement this, let's talk about what this really represents.

This isn't about being cheap. This is about understanding systems well enough to find inefficiencies and exploit them legally and ethically.

Google offers Spot VMs because they have excess capacity. Jio subsidizes Google Cloud because they want to drive 5G adoption. GitHub includes Grok Code Fast because they want developers on their platform.

None of this is "hacking" or "exploiting." It's arbitrage—finding price discrepancies across markets and taking advantage of them.

The same principle that lets hedge funds make millions trading currency differences applies here. You're just doing it with cloud infrastructure.

What This Means for the Future

The fact that you can run a sophisticated AI assistant for $0-4/month represents a massive shift:

1. Democratization of AI: You don't need a big budget to experiment with cutting-edge AI
2. Indie developer renaissance: Solo developers can build and scale AI products without VC funding
3. Cloud cost optimization: Forces cloud providers to compete on actual value, not just ecosystem lock-in

The real insight: The marginal cost of compute and AI inference is approaching zero. The only thing keeping prices high is information asymmetry—most people don't know these setups exist.

Conclusion: The Meta-Lesson

This post isn't just about saving $600/month on your AI assistant costs (though that's nice).

It's about developing the mental model to see these opportunities everywhere:

- Infrastructure arbitrage: Spot VMs, reserved instances, free tiers
- Partnership subsidies: Jio + Google, GitHub + xAI, cloud provider credits
- Open-source alternatives: Free models that match paid performance
- Architectural cleverness: Stateful disks, auto-healing, managed groups

The difference between burning $7,200/year and spending $0 isn't access to secret tools. It's taking the time to understand how these systems actually work beneath the marketing layer.

Most developers see cloud infrastructure as a black box: input money, get compute. But when you understand the economics—why Spot VMs exist, how partnerships create subsidies, where free tiers make business sense—you start seeing opportunities everywhere.

The framework:
1. Understand the full cost structure (not just headline pricing)
2. Identify legitimate arbitrage opportunities (partnerships, unused capacity)
3. Architect systems to take advantage of them (MIGs, stateful disks)
4. Stack multiple optimizations for compound savings

This is the same thinking that drives successful startups, trading strategies, and growth hacking. Applied to infrastructure, it lets you run enterprise-grade AI systems on a student budget.
